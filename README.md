A command line based text editor, written in python.

F-ide is a very highly customizable cli text  editor, with  many more featur


There are some bugs and things that need to be fixed:
 - automatic scrolling on the X-axis,
 - some key combination are printed forever, until pressed  again,
 - lines that only contain backslash n are duplicated everytime a file is opened
 - ctrl + c + v + x + a supporrt
 - on-key-basis keystroke delay to decrease accidental double-types
 - all keys are picked up, even not regular chars and when not focused
  - "media_play_pause" is added to the doc when you pause music.

TODO (in decreeasingly likely order):
 - fix the bugs
 - improvements mentioned above 
 - Syntax highlighting for programming languages
 - find, find+replace 
 - cli based file selector (?)
 - AI copilot support (?)

but some features are working (though buggy):
 - skipping between words with ctrl + < or > 
 - regular editing
 - logging
 - custom cursor, cursor color and selection color
